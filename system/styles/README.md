# `system/styles`

All of the styles windows99 uses. This is css.
## Rundown
* `themes` is the directory for all of the default themes included with windows99.
* `3party` are third party stylesheets.
* `bs.css` is the css used for a blue screen, which is currently used in the 404 page (`/404.html`) and will soon have more uses.
* `sys41.css` is the main css file used in windows99. *This will be split up into multiple files in the future, when more css is written.*
