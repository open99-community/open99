# TO-DO
in no particular order

- [x] finish boot (hooray about time)
- [x] finalize boot add api
- [x] finalize other boot logging API's
- [x] create better fs api
- [ ] create fs utils
- [ ] make boot logs classes
- [x] fix bug with localforage not working (haha this was because I was trying to save a function which isn't supported - I forgot the parentheses)
- [x] research localStorage (done, I think using localforage promises are best for this case)
- [ ] fix pwa not installable for some reason
- [ ] make good enough window system
- [ ] DO THINGS when booting (things that actually take time)
- [ ] Make window flashing feature (like in windows 10 kinda)
- [ ] consider renaming project to windows92
- [ ] *it is impossible* to cache all of the app files into the fs. consider moving open99-apps/src to system/applications or system/apps and reserve open99-apps for community-made apps. This way, the service worker will cache them.
- [ ] make File class and add utilities to it - this way, sys41.fs api will return a new File instance with the file
- [ ] make my own drag and drop thing for the window
